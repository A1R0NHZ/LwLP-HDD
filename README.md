## Overview
This project pioneers **next-gen AI-driven heart monitoring**, enabling real-time detection of cardiac conditions on **wearable devices and mobile phones**. Leveraging **Edge AI**, our models deliver lightning-fast, privacy-first diagnoses without relying on cloud connectivity.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Ultra-Lightweight AI Models**: Run seamlessly on power-limited devices.
- **Real-Time ECG Analysis**: Instant health insights without internet dependency.
- **Privacy-First Approach**: No data leaves your device, eliminating security risks.
- **Comprehensive Heart Condition Detection**:
  - **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**: Unstable, irregular heart rhythm.
  - **Paroxysmal AF**: Short, unpredictable AFib episodes.
  - **Persistent AF**: Prolonged AFib requiring medical intervention.
  - **Permanent AF**: Chronic AFib that cannot be reversed.
  - **Lone AF**: AFib in otherwise healthy individuals, often younger adults.
  - **Atrial Flutter (AFL)**: Rapid but structured atrial heartbeats.
  - **AV Junctional Rhythm (J)**: Occurs when the SA node fails to control the heart.
  - **Sinus Arrhythmia**: Natural fluctuation of heart rate with breathing.
  - **Sinus Tachycardia**: Elevated heart rate due to exertion or stress.
  - **Sinus Bradycardia**: Low heart rate, commonly observed in athletes.
  - **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)**: Early, irregular beats that may disrupt rhythm.
  - **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**: Dangerous rapid heartbeats originating in the ventricles.
  - **Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)**: Chaotic, life-threatening heart activity.
  - **Torsades de Pointes**: A rare but deadly form of ventricular tachycardia.
  - **Heart Failure Types**:
    - **Systolic Failure**: The heart struggles to pump efficiently.
    - **Diastolic Failure**: The heart has trouble filling properly.
    - **Right-Sided Failure**: Fluid retention in the body due to weak circulation.
    - **Left-Sided Failure**: Fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties.
    - **Acute Heart Failure**: Sudden, severe heart failure episode.
    - **Chronic Heart Failure**: Gradual decline in heart function over time.
